Very simply, this is a framework-free PHP/Javascript app where you can map a Google Maps Route with waypoints along with some routes customization

Libraries used: Bootstrap 5 and JQuery 3.7

This is optimized for PHP 8 and the newest Javascript

This uses SQLite3 as a database to keep things simple

You need to have your own Google Maps API key for this to work and it should be saved in a .env file (env.example provided)
